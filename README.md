# Image Generator (Flutter)

A clean Flutter app for searching and browsing images from the **Unsplash API**.  
Built to run on **Android** and **iOS**, with a smooth and responsive UI.

## Features
- Search images in real time (with debounce to reduce API calls)
- Infinite scroll (loads more results as you scroll)
- Category browsing (jump into pre-defined searches)
- Pull-to-refresh
- Cached images with placeholders for fast, smooth scrolling
- Hero animations for image previews
- Configurable via `.env` file (keeps API keys out of source control)
